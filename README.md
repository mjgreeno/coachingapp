# Pragmatic Strength Coaching App
This application is made to automate the strength programming and logging process. In addition meant to capture data for
data tracking purposes. Over time and population of data users will be able not only intuitively log workouts and see 
prescribed work. But also track work over time. 

This readme will also serve as my technical road map of work to be completed. Below are the major features to be built

- User login and access to their own workouts and information
- Coach login and access to information about their lifters and overall management
- Programming CMS i.e the ability to build a program and assign it to a client
- Programming adherence administration 
- Software subscription billing
- Admin/Client dashboard for progress tracking.
